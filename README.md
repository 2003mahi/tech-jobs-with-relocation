# International Tech Job Search Handbook

Relocation to a foreign country for work can be very exciting and lead to unique opportunities that couldn't be accessed in your home country. At the same time, it's a real challenge - I know it firsthand. You mind becomes inundated with questions:

*	How to prepare a resume?
* Where to find companies that hire foreign talent?
* What relocation assistance is typically provided?
*	How to get a work visa?

And the list goes on!

Hopefully, this handbook will give you the necessary guidance. Topics covered include resume preparation, job search, salary negotiation, relocation packages, and more.

# 🔖 Niche job boards that have a filter for relocation
* [Relocate.me](https://relocate.me/search): The site is built around and focused entirely on tech jobs that offer relocation.
* [AngelList](https://angel.co/jobs): If you go to the Filters tab, you will find a section named "Immigration + Network." There is an option to "only show companies that can sponsor a visa." Tick the box.
* [Landing.Jobs](https://landing.jobs/jobs?page=1&vs=true&hd=false&t_co=false&t_st=false): The main country that they feature is Portugal, but you can find tech jobs in other parts of Europe as well. When searching for jobs, make sure to select the gilter for "Visa & work permit."
* [SwissDevJobs](https://swissdevjobs.ch): For those looking to move to Switzerland, SwissDev Jobs is a great place to turn. The website allows you to easily locate developer jobs anywhere in Switzerland. In order to filter it to only jobs with relocation, you simply need to check the filter box for "Visa sponsorship for non-EU residents."
* [TokyoDev](https://www.tokyodev.com/jobs/): The site is dedicated to helping international developers start and grow their career in Japan. Among other things, you will find a list of job offerings from local employers that are open to hiring foreign, English-speaking techies.

# 🔖 Other places to check during the search
* "Who's hiring?" monthly thread on Hacker News. Here's a link to the latest one: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=29782099. Use the search feature (Command/Ctrl + F) to find job offerings with the keyword "visa."
* [@Relocateme](http://t.me/relocateme) Telegram channel with daily actual job alerts
* [Big list of local job boards](https://www.recruitingbrainfood.com/big-list-of-places-to-post-jobs-globally/)
* [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/): When searching, you should add "relocation," "visa support," or "visa sponsorship" into the keywords tab, and select the city/country/region that's your choice for relocation. Here's an [example](https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/search/?currentJobId=2809004062&geoId=91000000&keywords=visa%20support%20software%20developer&location=European%20Union).

**Note:** You can apply the same approach - typing "relocation" followed by your target job title in the search bar - to other sites (e.g., Indeed or Glassdoor) that, like LinkedIn, have no filter for relocation. Of course, you will find some jobs that don't offer relocation or are not quite what you are looking for, but overall using relevant keywords does a good job at filtering them out.
